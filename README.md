# About the Design

This project provides a simple React design featuring the following components:

1. **ParentComponent:** The main parent component that includes a title, a search bar, a member list, and buttons.
2. **SearchBar:** A component with a search icon and an input field to search for members.
3. **MemberList:** A component displaying a list of members with checkboxes.
4. **Buttons:** A component containing cancel and save buttons.
   The components are styled using CSS to achieve a basic non-functional mockup for adding members to a front-end
   development team.
